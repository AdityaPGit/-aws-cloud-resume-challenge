# Cloud Resume Challenge ☁️

The <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a> by <a href="https://github.com/forrestbrazeal">Forrest Brazeal</a> is a popular project for getting started with cloud and very beginner friendly.
The basic idea is to create a simple resume website hosted completely on AWS services like S3, CloudFront, Route53, etc. In the following project, I have not used Route53 as intended in the Cloud Resume Challenge to avoid buying a domain.
